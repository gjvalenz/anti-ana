# About

**anti-ana** is a Chrome extension developed that guides users away from pages that may trigger anorexic people.

The extension is quite simple: It extracts text content from the current page. If this content matches certain anorexic trigger words, it will redirect the user to help resources.

The extension is small now, and I expect bugs to be present, but I hope to further develop this extension.
